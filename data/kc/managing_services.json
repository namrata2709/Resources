The output includes multiple columns: UNIT (service name), LOAD (whether unit definition loaded successfully), ACTIVE (high-level activation state), SUB (low-level unit state like 'running' or 'exited'), and DESCRIPTION (human-readable description). Services showing 'active' with sub-state 'running' are actively executing, while 'active' with sub-state 'exited' means one-shot services that completed successfully. This command is crucial for system administration tasks: verifying services started after boot, troubleshooting failed services, auditing running services for security, and monitoring system health. You can combine multiple states with commas: --state=active,failed to see both active and failed services.",

High si/so values indicate memory pressure and active swapping, which severely degrades performance. vmstat can run continuously with a delay interval ('vmstat 2 10' updates every 2 seconds for 10 iterations) making it perfect for real-time monitoring during performance tests or problem diagnosis.

The -h (human-readable) option converts block counts into familiar units like MB, GB, and TB, making the output much easier to interpret. System administrators typically monitor df output to: prevent disk full conditions (which can crash services), plan capacity upgrades, identify unexpectedly growing filesystems, verify backup storage capacity, and track quota usage. The command is often used in monitoring scripts with thresholds ('df -h | grep -E \"9[0-9]%|100%\"' to find filesystems over 90% full). Note that df shows space from the filesystem perspective - the 'available' column accounts for reserved space (typically 5% on ext4 filesystems reserved for root).

The 'available' column is crucial - it's more meaningful than 'free' because Linux aggressively uses free memory for caching to improve performance. This cached memory can be instantly reclaimed if applications need it, so 'available' = 'free' + 'reclaimable cache'. Modern Linux systems often show low 'free' memory with high 'buff/cache' - this is normal and efficient. The swap section shows virtual memory usage; high swap usage typically indicates memory pressure. System administrators use free to: quickly assess memory availability, diagnose out-of-memory conditions, monitor memory trends during performance testing, verify memory upgrades, and determine if additional RAM is needed.",
