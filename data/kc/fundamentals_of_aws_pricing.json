            "summary": "AWS Cost Explorer is a tool for analyzing your actual AWS spending and usage history. It provides visualizations and reports of your historical costs, not estimates for future workloads.",
            "why": "Cost Explorer looks backward at what you've already spent. It helps you understand past spending patterns, identify trends, and forecast future costs based on historical usage. The Pricing Calculator looks forward to estimate costs for new or planned workloads before you deploy them.",
            "difference": "Cost Explorer = Historical actual costs; Pricing Calculator = Future estimated costs",
