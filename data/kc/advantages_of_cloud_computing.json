It refers to deploying infrastructure globally so you can serve customers wherever they are, but the customers themselves are users of YOUR application, not of AWS.",
            "why": "AWS is infrastructure—it doesn't provide customers, users, or traffic to your application. Customer acquisition is a business and marketing function. Cloud infrastructure enables you to serve customers globally once you have them, but doesn't generate the customers themselves.",
