            "summary": "A web server is specifically designed software that handles HTTP and HTTPS requests from clients (usually web browsers) and sends back the requested resources using the same protocol. When you type a URL into your browser and press Enter, your browser creates an HTTP request and sends it to a web server. The web server receives this request, processes it, and returns an HTTP response containing the webpage, image, CSS file, or other resource you requested.",

The web server receives the request, retrieves the HTML file for the homepage, and sends it back to your browser as an HTTP response. Your browser then renders the HTML to display the webpage.",
