Within this VPC, you create subnets in different Availability Zones for high availability. Each subnet can be public (routed to internet via internet gateway) or private (no direct internet access). Route tables control traffic flow between subnets and to external destinations. Security groups act as virtual firewalls at instance level, while Network ACLs provide subnet-level filtering. VPC enables you to replicate traditional data center networks with the scalability and elasticity of AWS Cloud. You can connect VPCs to each other via VPC Peering or Transit Gateway, and extend on-premises networks into AWS using VPN or Direct Connect. Default VPCs exist in each region with preconfigured subnets, but custom VPCs offer full control for production workloads.",

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation like 10.0.0.0/16 specifies the network address and prefix length. The /16 means the first 16 bits are fixed (10.0), leaving 16 bits for host addresses (2^16 = 65,536 addresses). AWS reserves 5 IP addresses per subnet (first 4 and last 1), so plan accordingly. RFC 1918 defines private address ranges: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 - using these avoids conflicts with public internet addresses. Choose CIDR carefully based on expected scale: too small limits growth, too large wastes address space. For enterprises, 10.0.0.0/16 provides 65,536 addresses allowing ~200+ subnets of /24 (256 addresses each). After initial creation, you can add secondary CIDR blocks if you need more addresses, but primary CIDR cannot change.

Best practice architecture uses three-tier design: public subnet for load balancers/web servers, private subnet for application logic, and isolated private subnet for databases. This layered approach ensures attackers must breach multiple security layers to reach data. Databases in private subnets have no route to internet gateway, making them unreachable from outside. Application servers in private or public subnets communicate with databases using private IP addresses within VPC. For administrative access and updates, use bastion hosts (jump boxes) in public subnets or AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, which doesn't require opening SSH ports. If databases need internet access for software updates or external API calls, attach NAT Gateway to enable outbound-only traffic without allowing inbound connections. This architecture meets compliance requirements like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and SOC 2 that mandate database isolation. Security groups on database instances should allow traffic only from specific application security groups, never from 0.0.0.0/0.",
