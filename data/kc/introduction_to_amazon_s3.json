            "summary": "The object value is the actual data content you store (such as a file, image, or document), not the identifier used to locate and retrieve it. While every object has a value, this is what you're storing, not how you identify or access it.",
            "why": "Object values are the contents of your files and can be identical across multiple objects. For example, you could have the same image stored in ten different locations with ten different keys. The value (image data) is the same, but each object needs a unique key to identify and retrieve it. Using object values as identifiers would be impractical since values can be duplicates and S3 would have no way to distinguish between identical files stored in different locations.",

            "why": "Metadata describes characteristics of an object but doesn't uniquely identify it within a bucket. Multiple objects can have identical metadata (same content type, same creation date, same custom tags), making metadata unsuitable as a unique identifier. Additionally, metadata can be modified after object creation without changing the object's identity. The object key is what uniquely identifies and locates an object, while metadata provides additional descriptive information about that object.",

The object key is always the primary identifier. When versioning is enabled, the combination of bucket name, object key, and version ID together uniquely identify a specific version of an object, but the key alone identifies the object within its bucket.

The 11 nines guarantee applies within a single AWS region. For even higher protection against regional disasters, customers can enable Cross-Region Replication. It's important to distinguish durability from availability—S3 Standard has 99.99% availability (designed for 52.56 minutes of downtime per year) but 11 nines durability (virtually no data loss).

With six nines, storing 10 million objects might result in losing 10 objects annually.

While this sounds impressive, it's still 1,000 times less durable than S3's actual design. The difference between eight and 11 nines is enormous in practical terms—it's the difference between potentially losing data from a large dataset within decades versus millennia.

            "why": "Four nines durability would be unacceptable for enterprise cloud storage, as it would mean losing one object per 10,000 objects over time—a catastrophic failure rate. This confusion often arises because S3 has two different metrics: 99.99% availability (four nines, referring to uptime) and 99.999999999% durability (11 nines, referring to data preservation). Availability measures how often you can access your data, while durability measures whether your data is permanently preserved.

Financial companies specifically mentioned in the question need maximum durability for compliance archives that cannot be recreated, making single-zone storage inappropriate.

The global namespace has occasionally caused issues like bucket name squatting (reserving popular names) or naming conflicts during company mergers, but it provides the benefit of simple, predictable URL structures.

            "summary": "S3 cannot host dynamic websites that require server-side processing. S3 only serves static files and cannot execute server-side code like PHP, Python, Java, Ruby, or Node.js that generates pages dynamically based on user input or database queries.",
            "why": "Dynamic websites need application servers to process code, query databases, handle user sessions, generate personalized content, and perform authentication—capabilities S3 doesn't provide. S3 is object storage that simply serves files as-is without any processing. For dynamic applications, you need compute services like EC2 (virtual servers), Elastic Beanstalk (managed application hosting), Lambda (serverless functions), or ECS (containers). However, S3 can be part of a dynamic application architecture by serving static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) while APIs handle dynamic functionality, which is the JAMstack pattern.",
            "examples": [
              "Cannot run on S3: WordPress (PHP + MySQL), Django applications, e-commerce sites with shopping carts",
              "Can run on S3: React/Vue/Angular SPAs that call backend APIs for dynamic data"
            ],
