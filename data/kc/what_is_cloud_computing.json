            "summary": "This statement describes traditional on-premises IT infrastructure, not cloud computing. One of the fundamental advantages of cloud computing is that it eliminates the need for customers to purchase, maintain, and manage physical hardware.",

The cloud provider owns and manages all physical infrastructure including servers, storage devices, networking equipment, and data centers. Customers access these resources virtually over the internet without touching physical hardware. This is the opposite of what cloud computing offers—freedom from hardware management is one of its core value propositions.",

Traditional IT requires predicting capacity needs months in advance, purchasing expensive hardware, and paying for peak capacity even during low-demand periods. Cloud computing eliminates over-provisioning waste and under-provisioning risk by enabling precise capacity matching to real-time demand. This shift enables businesses to innovate faster, reduce financial risk, and focus resources on core business activities rather than infrastructure management.",

            "why": "Fixed-price contracts contradict the core flexibility advantage of cloud computing. The pay-as-you-go model allows customers to scale usage up or down without penalty, paying only for what they actually consume. This eliminates waste from paying for unused capacity and removes the risk of capacity shortages. While customers can optionally purchase reserved instances or savings plans for predictable workloads (receiving discounts of 30-70% compared to on-demand prices), these are optional cost optimization strategies, not requirements.
